		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>Heartwood Bakery is a small scale home bakery that merges a passion for baking and wholesome food.</p>
		<p>We source local, regional and organic ingredients whenever possible for our sourdough breads, cookies, crackers and pies.  Our current offerings are made with regionally grown, organic whole-grain flours, including whole wheat, rye, and oat flour. Our pies are made using seasonal, local fruit, and many of the sweeteners in our products are minimally processed and include local maple syrup and local honey.</p>
		<p>We are currently on hiatus, but hope to resume our baking adventures in late spring 2022.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Imagine a bakery snug in the hollow of a giant, old growth oak tree, run by a team of well-trained red squirrels, skunks and maybe a hedgehog or two.  The scent of cinnamon, cardamom and chocolate mingle with pine, juniper and violet in the early morning air, as the bakers scoop flour to mix and fold into sourdough, gently knead raisins into brioche, and sprinkle dried lavender over shortbread for their forest neighbors.</p>
		<p>Welcome to Heartwood Bakery, a bakery born in the imaginations of our children when they were small, now made real!  Alas, we haven’t figured out how to make the bakery in a giant tree work...yet.</p>

			<p>Hi, I’m Wendy Flanigan, the baker (wannabe red squirrel baking for her forest friends in a tree). I’m a life-long, self-taught baker, but since 2015, I’ve been baking at home, using the guidelines of Michigan’s <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/food-dairy/michigan-cottage-foods-information">Cottage Food Law</a>.  I have sold my products at Cobblestone Farm Market and Blue Spring Farm in Ann Arbor.</p>
